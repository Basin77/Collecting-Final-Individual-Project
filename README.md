## Text analysis of Google News about Israel and Hamas

## Introduce
Since the Hamas terrorist attack at the concert on October 7, 2023, the Middle East has once again become the focus of the world. In the following period, a lot of news about this war was reported.
In this study, I hope to use the tools of textual research to analyze the content of news texts about the war between Israel and Hamas in Google News.

## tool
During the research process, the research tools I mainly used were word clouds, VADER lexicon and TF-IDF modeling tools for text analysis.

## CSV Profile

Time (the release time)
Description (the text content of the news)

## Goal of the Analysis
I wish to examine several aspects of news release timing, news text themes, news headline keywords, and sentiment analysis.

1.What are the differences in the emotional attitudes of the texts presented for both sides of the story?
2.Did the content of the reports change over time?
3.What is the theme model of the news?
