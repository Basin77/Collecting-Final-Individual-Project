"Where Is Hamas Getting Its Weapons? Increasingly, From Israel.","Sun, 28 Jan 2024 08:01:45 GMT","Israeli military and intelligence officials have concluded that a significant number of weapons used by Hamas in the Oct. 7 attacks and in the war in Gaza came from an unlikely source: the Israeli military itself.

Hamas is also arming its fighters with weapons stolen from Israeli military bases.
What is clear now is that the very weapons that Israeli forces have used to enforce a blockade of Gaza over the past 17 years are now being used against them.
Israeli and American military explosives have enabled Hamas to shower Israel with rockets and, for the first time, penetrate Israeli towns from Gaza.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMjgvd29ybGQvbWlkZGxlZWFzdC9pc3JhZWwtaGFtYXMtd2VhcG9ucy1yb2NrZXRzLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5
